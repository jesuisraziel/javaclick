This is Heisei's simple autoclicker, version 1.0.1

It's not meant to be public, and was only built to satisfy to a friend of mine's needs.

It's ugly as sin, because learning GUI design is a different monster altogether.

If you got your hands on it and you're not someone I personally know, consider this our little secret, okay?

It uses JNativeHook. Go check it out, and you'll probably be able to write something much better than this dingy little thing.

If you find it useful, consider buying me a coffee at https://www.ko-fi-com/heisei

I hope your day goes well, and you find success in your endevors, no matter who you are, or where you are.

You've got this. I believe in you.

- Heisei.
